# Build your own stuff

The repo unifies the solutions for https://codingchallenges.substack.com/

Each subproject contains the framework for testing:
- run: `cd ~`
- clone the whole repo
- run: `cd build-your-own-stuff/{subproject}`

And then running the `executable`:
- `executable $arg1 $arg2`

And so on...
